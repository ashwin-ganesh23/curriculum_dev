Introduction to Data Types and Variables

Variables are reserved memory locations that can be used to store values
Variables are created by using the assignment operator ( = ), to store values


We will begin our exploration of data types with these four common types:
-integers
-floats
-strings
-booleans

# Integers are positive and negative WHOLE numbers
your_age = 15
my_age = 24


# Floats are positive and negative numbers with decimal values
your_height = 5.4
my_height = 6.0


# Strings are collections of letters, number, and symbols.
# Must be surrounded by quotations - either single ' ' or double " "
greetings = "Welcome to Peerbuds Innovation Lab!"
philosophy = "We believe in peer to peer, project-based learning"
why = "We believe that students learn better through interactive activities that challenge their need for exploration"


# Booleans are True or False values.
# Must be spelled with a capital letter because they are keywords in Python.
am_excited = True
bored = False
