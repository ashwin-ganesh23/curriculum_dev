Review of Variables

In our first Introduction to Python meetup, we covered variables and data types in python!

"""

# Python uses dynamic typing, which means you do not have to declare the variable type

# Simply assign a value using the assignment operator ( = )

# Variables cannot begin with a number or symbol BESIDES an underscore ( _ ) Variable names cannot be separated by spaces
